    <h1 id="para">Who We Are</h1>
    <p>We are a group of highschool students with big goals. We are all orphans and were raised by our adoptive father, Mr. Jim Morales. He was a great father with special interest towards keeping the ocean clean and safe, naturally, we followed his footsteps. However, one day he experienced a car accident with severe damage, due to this, he had to be transported to a special hospital in Cebu, where we never know when he'll return.</p>
    <p>To fill the hole our father left behind, our group created this advocacy project where we aim to save every aquatic animal and clean up our oceans. Some might say that this is too ambitious for a group of highschoolers, but in my eyes, age doesn't matter when making a project, but rather, it's the effort you give into making it a reality.</p>

    <h1 id="para">Who am I?</h1>
    <p>I am Zeus, a highschool student who has been interested in the ocean since I was 7. I have been joining ocean projects ever since I turned 10 and still continue to do so. Earth's bodies of water are fascinating creations in my eyes, and it hurts to see them constantly being damaged with no signs of stopping, thus, I created SEAA along with my brothers to try and stop this issue. </p>
